# uttest
 This project parses a JSON file which describes a menu, and calculates the SUM of the IDs of all "items", as long as a "label" exists for that item.
 This is achieved through a console application and Newtonsoft.Json package. 
 The solution also has a test Project to test the expected output. 
 
 Constraints: The JSON file has a particular format and is expected in the application path.
